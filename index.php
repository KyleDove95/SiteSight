There will be the homepage, user pages, and tag pages. The user page will contain a list of tags that will take the user to the tag page when clicked. the tag page will have an aside element with a list of the user's tags followed by a brief description of the tag page. The tag page will have a 2-by-n or 3-by-n array of "tiles" about the same size as the header that will take the user to a website that it is linked to. There will be several additional options that a user can operate to change the appearance of the tile.</p>
